# CostFinders Tone Guidelines

## Voice vs Tone

**Voice** is who we are. It's consistent across all communications, a reflection of CostFinders' personality: trustworthy, helpful, clear, confident, and approachable.

**Tone** is how we adapt our voice to different situations and audiences. The same voice can shift from warm and encouraging (consumer celebrating a claimed deal) to efficient and respectful (business owner managing leads) to factual and action-oriented (admin moderating content).

Think of it like a person: their personality (voice) stays the same, but they naturally adjust how they speak depending on whether they're talking to a friend, a colleague, or in a professional meeting.
