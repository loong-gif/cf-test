## Voice Overview

CostFinders sounds like a knowledgeable friend who works in the medical spa industry. We communicate with clarity and warmth, helping consumers discover valuable treatments while supporting business owners in growing their practices.

## Core Voice Traits

### 1. Trustworthy

**Definition:** We earn trust through transparency, accuracy, and consistency. Users are sharing personal information and making decisions about their appearance, so we never oversell or obscure important details.

**In Practice:**
- Present deal information clearly without hidden catches
- Use precise language about prices, discounts, and terms
- Acknowledge limitations honestly (e.g., "Deal expires in 3 days")

**Examples:**
- "Your information stays private until you claim a deal." (direct, honest)
- "50% off Botox treatment ($199, normally $400)" (clear value proposition)
- "This business hasn't been verified yet." (transparent status)

---

### 2. Helpful

**Definition:** We anticipate user needs and provide guidance without being pushy. Our goal is to make complex decisions simple and remove friction from the process.

**In Practice:**
- Offer next steps proactively
- Explain unfamiliar terms or processes
- Provide context that aids decision-making

**Examples:**
- "Looking for more? Browse similar deals nearby." (anticipates need)
- "Claims typically get contacted within 24 hours." (sets expectations)
- "Complete your profile to get personalized recommendations." (guides improvement)

---

### 3. Clear

**Definition:** We communicate in plain language that anyone can understand. Medical spa terminology can be intimidating, and deal structures can be confusing, so we translate complexity into simplicity.

**In Practice:**
- Use short sentences and common words
- Avoid jargon unless necessary (then explain it)
- Structure information hierarchically (most important first)

**Examples:**
- "Save your favorites" (not "Add to wishlist collection")
- "Deal expires Jan 15" (not "Offer valid through the 15th instant")
- "8 people claimed this week" (not "Weekly claim velocity: 8")

---

### 4. Confident

**Definition:** We speak with assurance without being arrogant. We know our platform delivers value, and we communicate that certainty through direct, affirmative language.

**In Practice:**
- Use active voice and strong verbs
- Avoid hedging language ("maybe," "might," "perhaps")
- State facts and actions directly

**Examples:**
- "Claim this deal" (not "You might want to claim this deal")
- "Your claim was submitted." (not "Your claim has been successfully submitted!")
- "3 new leads today" (not "You might have received around 3 leads")

---

### 5. Approachable

**Definition:** We're warm without being overly casual. Medical spa services are about self-improvement, which should feel positive and empowering, not clinical or transactional.

**In Practice:**
- Use conversational sentence structure
- Include encouraging moments at key touchpoints
- Avoid cold, robotic, or bureaucratic language

**Examples:**
- "Great choice." (brief affirmation)
- "You're all set." (completion confirmation)
- "Welcome back." (returning user greeting)
