## Overview

Build the complete CostFinders UI — a price transparency and lead generation platform for medical spas.

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- Phase 3.1: Image Blur (inserted after Phase 3 for anonymous user privacy)

**Key Decisions:**

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| UI-only build with mock data | Separate team handles backend; allows parallel development |
| Single app with role-based views | Simpler deployment, shared components, unified codebase |
| Location-first discovery | Medspa services are local; location is primary filter |
| Account creation triggers reveal | Ensures verified contact info before showing business details |
| Three-tier business model | Supports gradual monetization as markets develop |
| Glassmorphic design system | Medium-dark theme with glass effects, strategic whitespace |
| Biome over ESLint | Faster unified tooling, native TypeScript support |
| CSS-first tokens | All values in :root variables, TS exports reference them |
| AnonymousDeal pattern | Consumer-safe type excludes businessId, includes area/rating |
| localStorage for client state | Simpler for UI-only build, no mock data mutations |
| Mock verification any 6 digits | No real email/SMS for MVP |
| Icon-only sidebar with tooltips | Minimal footprint (64px), labels via Tooltip on hover |

**Issues Resolved:**
- None reported during milestone

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Mock data layer will need replacement with Supabase integration
- Some inline mock data in admin pages for preview purposes
- No real authentication or session management
