# Phase 3.1: Image Blur for Anonymous Users - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Deal images show the business — they're part of the "hidden until verified" content. Non-logged-in users should see a heavily blurred version of the image with a lock icon overlay, making it clear this content is locked.

When a user creates an account and verifies, the blur lifts and they see the actual business photos. This reinforces the value of creating an account — you're not just getting contact info, you're getting the full picture.

The blur effect should be consistent everywhere deals appear: browse page cards and detail page hero images. A unified experience that says "there's more here when you sign up."

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Heavy blur effect** - The image should be clearly obscured, not subtly hinted at
- **Lock icon overlay** - Centered lock icon makes the "locked" status unmistakable
- **Consistent everywhere** - DealCard thumbnails AND detail page hero images both blurred
- **Part of the anonymous pattern** - Fits with the existing "business details hidden" messaging

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Actual authentication integration - that's Phase 4
- Conditional reveal based on auth state - Phase 4 will wire that up
- Mobile-specific treatments - same approach desktop and mobile

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Heavy blur (filter: blur) rather than pixelation or color overlay
- Lock icon should be prominent, centered on the blurred image
- Should feel premium/mysterious, not broken or missing
- May want subtle "unlock" messaging but lock icon is the priority

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This is an insertion phase (3.1) that enhances the Phase 3 anonymous display pattern. The components already exist (DealCard, deal detail page) — this adds the blur/lock layer.

Phase 4 (Consumer Auth) will later add the logic to conditionally show blurred vs revealed based on authentication state. For now, we build the blur UI assuming all users are anonymous.
