# Consumer dashboard pattern to mirror:
@src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx
@src/components/layout/dashboardSidebar.tsx

# Business auth context:
@src/lib/context/businessAuthContext.tsx
@src/types/businessOwner.ts

**Tech stack available:** BusinessAuthContext, BusinessOwner type, existing dashboard patterns
**Established patterns:** Icon-only sidebar with tooltips, auth-gated layouts, glassmorphic cards
**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 06-01: BusinessAuthContext mirrors consumer pattern
- Phase 05-01: Icon-only sidebar with tooltips (64px width)

  <files>src/components/layout/businessDashboardSidebar.tsx</files>
  <action>Create icon-only sidebar mirroring consumer DashboardSidebar pattern. Navigation items: Home (House), Deals (Tag), Leads (Users), Messages (ChatCircle), Analytics (ChartLine), Profile (Buildings), Settings (Gear).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create business dashboard layout and home page</name>
  <files>src/app/business/dashboard/layout.tsx, src/app/business/dashboard/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Layout: Auth-gated layout using useBusinessAuth (redirect to /business if not authenticated or no businessId linked). Include BusinessDashboardSidebar, main content area with md:pl-16 for sidebar offset.

Home page: Overview dashboard with glassmorphic cards showing:
- Active Deals count (mock: 5)
- New Leads this week (mock: 12)
- Messages awaiting reply (mock: 3)
- Total views this month (mock: 1,234)

Use Card component, grid layout (2x2 on desktop, 1 column mobile). Each card has icon, metric value, label, and subtle trend indicator. Welcome message using business name from linked businessId.
