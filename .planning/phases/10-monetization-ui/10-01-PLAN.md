**Tech stack available:**
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS v4 with glassmorphic design tokens
- Phosphor Icons (@phosphor-icons/react)
- BusinessTier type: 'unclaimed' | 'free' | 'paid'

**Established patterns:**
- Card component with glass variant
- Badge component for tier indicators
- Business dashboard layout at /business/dashboard/

**Key files:**
@src/types/business.ts
@src/components/ui/card.tsx
@src/components/ui/badge.tsx
@src/app/business/dashboard/settings/page.tsx

**Decisions:**
- UI-only build, no real Stripe connection
- Three-tier model: Unclaimed → Free → Paid
- Account settings currently disabled with "Coming Soon"

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create PricingTierCard and TierComparison components</name>
  <files>src/components/features/pricingTierCard.tsx, src/components/features/tierComparison.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create PricingTierCard component in features/ layer:
- Props: tier ('free' | 'paid'), isCurrentTier, onSelect, highlighted (for recommended)
- Display tier name, price (Free: $0/mo, Paid: $99/mo mock), feature list
- Free tier features: Basic listing, Lead notifications, Profile editing
- Paid tier features: Featured placements, Priority lead routing, Analytics dashboard, Newsletter inclusion, Sponsored deal slots
- Use Card with glass variant, Badge for "Current Plan" or "Recommended"
- CTA button: "Current Plan" (disabled) or "Upgrade Now"
- Glassmorphic styling with brand colors for highlighted tier

Create TierComparison component:
- Side-by-side or stacked (mobile) display of both tiers
- Header: "Choose Your Plan" with subtitle
- Uses PricingTierCard for each tier
- Highlight paid tier as recommended
- "All plans include..." section at bottom with shared features
  </action>
  <verify>Components render without errors when imported in a test page</verify>
  <done>PricingTierCard displays tier info with proper styling, TierComparison shows both tiers</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create tier upgrade page and integrate with business settings</name>
  <files>src/app/business/dashboard/settings/account/page.tsx, src/app/business/dashboard/settings/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create account settings page at /business/dashboard/settings/account/:
- Import TierComparison component
- Show current plan status at top (using BusinessAuthContext to get current business tier)
- Display TierComparison for upgrade selection
- "Upgrade Now" button routes to /business/dashboard/settings/account/checkout (to be built in 10-02)
- Back link to settings

Update settings/page.tsx:
- Enable the "Account" link (remove disabled: true)
- Update href to '/business/dashboard/settings/account'
- Keep CreditCard icon
- Update description to "View subscription and billing"
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, /business/dashboard/settings shows enabled Account link, /business/dashboard/settings/account displays tier comparison</verify>
  <done>Account settings page shows tier comparison, upgrade flow initiated from business settings</done>
</task>

</tasks>
