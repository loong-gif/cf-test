**Prior phase context:**
@.planning/phases/10-monetization-ui/10-01-SUMMARY.md (if exists)

**Tech stack available:**
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS v4 with glassmorphic design tokens
- Phosphor Icons (@phosphor-icons/react)
- Input, Button, Card components

**Established patterns:**
- Form patterns from business profile editing
- Card glass variant for containers
- Mock data utilities pattern

**Key files:**
@src/components/ui/input.tsx
@src/components/ui/button.tsx
@src/components/ui/card.tsx
@src/app/business/dashboard/settings/account/page.tsx

**Decisions:**
- UI-only build, no real Stripe connection
- Mock payment forms that mirror Stripe Elements layout
- Billing history with mock invoice data

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create mock checkout page with Stripe-like layout</name>
  <files>src/app/business/dashboard/settings/account/checkout/page.tsx, src/components/features/mockPaymentForm.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create MockPaymentForm component:
- Card number input with placeholder "4242 4242 4242 4242"
- Expiry (MM/YY) and CVC inputs in row
- Cardholder name input
- Country/region dropdown (mock with US options)
- All inputs use our Input component with glassmorphic styling
- Credit card icon in card number field
- Visual card brand detection mockup (Visa icon for 4xxx)
- "Subscribe" button with price summary

Create checkout page at /business/dashboard/settings/account/checkout/:
- Two-column layout (mobile stacks)
- Left: Order summary (Paid tier, $99/mo, what's included)
- Right: MockPaymentForm
- Back link to account settings
- Success state: Show confirmation with mock subscription ID
- Use CreditCard, CheckCircle, Lock icons from Phosphor
- "Secure checkout" indicator with Lock icon
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, /business/dashboard/settings/account/checkout renders checkout form</verify>
  <done>Checkout page displays order summary and mock payment form with Stripe-like layout</done>
</task>

  <name>Task 2: Create billing history and payment method management</name>
  <files>src/components/features/billingHistory.tsx, src/components/features/paymentMethods.tsx, src/lib/mock-data/billing.ts</files>
  <action>
Create billing mock data (src/lib/mock-data/billing.ts):
- Mock invoices array: id, date, amount, status (paid/pending/failed), description
- Mock payment methods: id, brand (visa/mastercard), last4, expMonth, expYear, isDefault
- Export getInvoices(), getPaymentMethods()

Create BillingHistory component:
- Table/list of invoices with date, amount, status badge, download link (mock)
- Status badges: Paid (success), Pending (warning), Failed (error)
- Empty state if no invoices
- "View all" link placeholder

Create PaymentMethods component:
- List of saved payment methods with card brand icon, last4, expiry
- Default badge for primary method
- "Add payment method" button (opens modal or inline form)
- "Remove" action with confirmation
- Edit default method dropdown
  </action>
  <verify>Components render correctly with mock data</verify>
  <done>BillingHistory shows invoice list, PaymentMethods shows saved cards with add/remove actions</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Integrate billing components into account page</name>
  <files>src/app/business/dashboard/settings/account/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update account page to include billing sections:
- Section 1: Current Plan (from 10-01, with "Change Plan" link)
- Section 2: Payment Methods component
- Section 3: Billing History component
- Section 4: Quick actions (Cancel subscription - mock confirmation modal)

Add tab or section navigation:
- "Plan" tab: TierComparison from 10-01
- "Billing" tab: PaymentMethods + BillingHistory
- Use simple tab pattern or accordion sections

Wire up navigation:
- From TierComparison "Upgrade" → checkout page
- From checkout success → back to account with success message
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, /business/dashboard/settings/account shows all billing sections</verify>
  <done>Account page displays plan selection, payment methods, and billing history in organized sections</done>
</task>
