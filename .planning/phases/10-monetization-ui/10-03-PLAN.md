**Prior phase context:**
@.planning/phases/10-monetization-ui/10-02-SUMMARY.md (if exists)

**Tech stack available:**
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS v4 with glassmorphic design tokens
- Phosphor Icons (@phosphor-icons/react)
- Deal type with isSponsored: boolean field

**Established patterns:**
- Deal management at /business/dashboard/deals
- Badge component for sponsored indicator
- Form patterns from deal editing

**Key files:**
@src/types/deal.ts
@src/components/features/dealCard.tsx
@src/app/business/dashboard/deals/page.tsx

**Decisions:**
- isSponsored field already exists in Deal type
- Sponsored badge pattern established in dealCard
- UI-only, no real payment processing for boosts
