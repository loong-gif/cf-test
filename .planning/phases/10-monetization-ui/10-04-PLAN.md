  <name>Task 1: Create lead pricing and credits mock data and components</name>
  <files>src/lib/mock-data/leadPricing.ts, src/components/features/leadPricingCard.tsx, src/components/features/leadCreditsDisplay.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create lead pricing mock data (src/lib/mock-data/leadPricing.ts):
- Lead pricing tiers by business tier:
  - Free tier: $5 per lead

- Credit packages:
  - 10 credits: $45 ($4.50/lead)
  - 25 credits: $100 ($4.00/lead)
  - 50 credits: $175 ($3.50/lead)
  - 100 credits: $300 ($3.00/lead)
- Mock business credits: { available: 15, used: 35, totalPurchased: 50 }
- Export getLeadPricing(), getCreditPackages(), getBusinessCredits()

Create LeadPricingCard component:
- Props: tierPricing, currentTier
- Display per-lead cost for current tier
- Comparison showing savings on paid tier (if on free)
- "Upgrade to save X%" CTA for free tier businesses
- Use Users, CurrencyDollar icons

- Props: credits (available, used, total)
- Visual progress/gauge of credits used vs available
- "Buy More Credits" button
- Credit usage history summary (this month, last month)
- Low credit warning when < 5 remaining
  </action>
  <verify>Components render with mock data showing pricing and credits</verify>
  <done>LeadPricingCard shows per-lead costs, LeadCreditsDisplay shows credit balance</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create lead pricing page and integrate with leads section</name>
  <files>src/app/business/dashboard/leads/pricing/page.tsx, src/components/features/creditPurchaseModal.tsx</files>
