**From Phase 16 Audit:**
- Total messages cataloged: 927 across all modules
- Consumer: 214 (23.1%), Business: 429 (46.3%), Admin: 284 (30.6%)
- Key inconsistencies identified: capitalization, punctuation, terminology, tone variations

**Audit Recommendations to Address:**
1. Capitalization: Choose sentence case for all UI text, Title Case only for proper nouns
2. Button verbs: Standardize action verbs (Save, Create, Submit, Verify)
3. Error messages: Use "{Field} is required" and "Please {action}" patterns
4. Empty states: Always include helpful CTA, end with period
5. Module-specific tone: Friendly (consumer), Professional (business), Clear (admin)

**Output Structure:**
```
.planning/messaging/
  VOICE.md           - Brand voice principles
  TONE.md            - Module-specific tone guidelines
  WRITING-RULES.md   - Capitalization, punctuation, terminology standards

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Brand Voice Principles</name>
  <files>.planning/messaging/VOICE.md</files>
  <action>
Create .planning/messaging/ directory and VOICE.md defining CostFinders brand voice:

**Document Structure:**
1. **Voice Overview** - What CostFinders sounds like in 2-3 sentences
2. **Core Voice Traits** - 4-5 personality attributes with definitions and examples
   - Recommended traits based on platform type: Trustworthy, Helpful, Clear, Confident, Approachable
3. **Voice "Do's and Don'ts"** - Concrete examples of voice in action
4. **Voice Keywords** - Words that embody the brand vs words to avoid

**Key Considerations:**
- Medical spa context: balance professional credibility with accessibility
- Deal platform: emphasize value without being salesy
- Lead generation: build trust for business reveal moment
- Use concrete examples from existing copy where possible

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Module Tone Guidelines</name>
  <files>.planning/messaging/TONE.md</files>
  <action>
Create TONE.md defining how the brand voice adapts across modules:

**Document Structure:**
1. **Voice vs Tone** - Brief explanation that voice is consistent, tone adapts to context
2. **Consumer Module Tone**
   - Characteristics: Warm, encouraging, builds trust
   - Use cases: Browse deals, claim flow, empty states
   - Example phrases with tone annotations
3. **Business Module Tone**
   - Characteristics: Professional, efficient, respectful of time
   - Use cases: Dashboard, lead management, analytics
   - Example phrases with tone annotations
4. **Admin Module Tone**
   - Characteristics: Clear, factual, action-oriented
   - Use cases: Moderation, user management, reports
   - Example phrases with tone annotations
5. **Tone Spectrum** - Visual guide showing when to shift tone (e.g., error states, success moments)

**Key Considerations:**
- Reference audit findings for module-specific examples
- Include "before/after" examples showing tone adaptation
- Cover edge cases: errors, empty states, success messages per module
  </action>
  <verify>File exists at .planning/messaging/TONE.md with all 5 sections</verify>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create Writing Standards</name>
  <files>.planning/messaging/WRITING-RULES.md</files>
  <action>
Create WRITING-RULES.md codifying the mechanical writing standards:

**Document Structure:**
1. **Capitalization Rules**
   - UI text: Sentence case (only first word + proper nouns capitalized)
   - Headings: Sentence case
   - Buttons: Sentence case ("Create account", not "Create Account")
   - Proper nouns list: CostFinders, specific feature names

2. **Punctuation Standards**
   - Periods: Always in complete sentences, empty state descriptions
   - Exclamation marks: Avoid in UI; reserve for truly celebratory moments
   - Ellipsis: Use "..." in search placeholders, instruction-style inputs
   - Ampersand: "&" in short labels/titles, "and" in body copy

3. **Article Usage**
   - "Create account" (no article) for common actions
   - "Create a new listing" (with article) for emphasis/creation flows
   - "Your business" for user's own, "The business" for others

4. **Terminology Glossary**
   - Standardized terms table: Deal (not Offer/Special), Claim (consumer), Lead (business)
   - Module-specific vocabulary mappings

5. **Common Patterns**
   - Error messages: "{Field} is required", "Please {action}"
   - Success messages: "{Action} successful" (with period, no exclamation)
   - Empty states: Title + description (ending with period) + CTA
   - Placeholders: "Search {noun}...", "e.g., Example" for hints

6. **Numbers & Formatting**
   - Currency: "$X" (no space)
   - Percentages: "X%" (no space)
   - Time: Relative time thresholds per audit
   - Dates: "Jan 12, 2026" format

**Key Considerations:**
- Reference specific inconsistencies from audit
- Provide clear "before/after" examples for each rule
- Make rules actionable - developer can apply without interpretation
  </action>
  <verify>File exists at .planning/messaging/WRITING-RULES.md with all 6 sections</verify>
  <done>WRITING-RULES.md contains capitalization, punctuation, articles, glossary, patterns, and formatting rules with examples</done>
