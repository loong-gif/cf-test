<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create unified MESSAGING-STYLE-GUIDE.md</name>
  <files>docs/MESSAGING-STYLE-GUIDE.md</files>
  <action>
Create comprehensive messaging style guide by compiling and structuring all 8 source guides. Structure as follows:

1. **Introduction** (new content)
   - Purpose of this guide
   - How to use it (quick reference vs deep dive)
   - When to consult vs when to deviate
   - Links to related docs (style-guide.md)

2. **Voice & Tone** (from VOICE.md + TONE.md)
   - Core voice traits (Trustworthy, Helpful, Clear, Confident, Warm)
   - Tone spectrum by context (Consumer/Business/Admin × Emotional state)
   - Voice application examples

3. **Writing Standards** (from WRITING-RULES.md)
   - Capitalization rules (sentence case)
   - Punctuation standards
   - Number and date formatting
   - Terminology glossary
   - Prohibited words/phrases

4. **UI Copy Patterns** (from ERROR-MESSAGES.md + SUCCESS-MESSAGES.md + EMPTY-STATES.md)
   - Error message anatomy and examples by module
   - Success/confirmation patterns
   - Empty state messaging guidelines

5. **Form Copy** (from FORM-VALIDATION.md)
   - Field labels, placeholders, help text
   - Validation message patterns
   - Field-specific copy reference

6. **Notification Copy** (from NOTIFICATIONS.md)
   - Email templates and anatomy
   - SMS constraints and templates
   - In-app notification patterns (toast, banner, badge)

7. **Quick Reference** (new content - developer-focused)
   - Cheat sheet: common patterns at a glance
   - Do's and Don'ts summary
   - Copy checklist for new features

Format: Clean markdown with clear hierarchy, collapsible sections where appropriate using HTML details/summary tags for long reference tables. Keep actionable guidance prominent, move exhaustive lists to collapsible sections.

Target length: ~600-800 lines (comprehensive but navigable)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update project references</name>
  <files>CLAUDE.md, docs/style-guide.md</files>
  <action>
1. **Update CLAUDE.md** - Add reference to messaging guide in appropriate section:
   - In "Key Files" section, add: `docs/MESSAGING-STYLE-GUIDE.md` - Messaging patterns and copy standards
   - In "Self-Documentation" section or similar, mention messaging guide for copy-related changes

2. **Update docs/style-guide.md** - Add cross-reference to messaging guide:
   - Add a "Related Documentation" section at the end (if not present)
   - Link to MESSAGING-STYLE-GUIDE.md for all copy/messaging/UX writing needs
   - Keep style-guide.md focused on visual design, defer messaging to new guide

3. **Clean up** - Ensure no duplicate documentation:
   - The individual .planning/messaging/*.md files remain as working documents
   - docs/MESSAGING-STYLE-GUIDE.md is the canonical developer reference
   - Add note in .planning/messaging/ directory about relationship to compiled guide
  </action>
  <verify>
- CLAUDE.md references MESSAGING-STYLE-GUIDE.md
- style-guide.md has cross-reference section
- No conflicting guidance between documents
  </verify>
  <done>
- All project docs point to new messaging guide
- Clear separation: style-guide.md (visual) vs MESSAGING-STYLE-GUIDE.md (copy)
- Developer knows where to find messaging guidance
  </done>
