======Complete Platform Overview========

## What Is CostFinders?

CostFinders is a **price transparency and lead generation platform** that connects consumers seeking local services with businesses offering exclusive deals. Starting with medical spas, the platform aggregates pricing information that's typically hidden, enabling consumers to compare options while generating high-quality, pre-qualified leads for businesses.

Think of it as the intersection of **Kayak** (price comparison), **Groupon** (deals), and **Zocdoc** (booking) — but purpose-built for service-based businesses where pricing is notoriously opaque.

## The Problem We Solve

### For Consumers

- Prices aren't listed online — requires calling multiple businesses
- First-time deals are buried across websites, social media, and email lists
- No easy way to compare options side-by-side
- Decision fatigue leads to settling or giving up

### For Businesses

- Marketing spend goes toward low-intent browsers
- No way to know if a lead already understands pricing
- Competing on visibility rather than value
- Difficulty measuring marketing ROI

### IMPORTANT NOTES
 - We do not require businesses to sign up in order for the app to include company details, service offerings, promos, or specials because we scrape the web to find this information from public sources.
 - CostFinders scrapes organic social posts, social media ads, 3rd party websites, 3rd party booking platforms, and other proprietary processes. All are from public sources.
 - Businesses who sign up are able to control their company information, service offerings, price lists, promos, and specials.

## The "Anonymous Until Committed" Model

CostFinders' key differentiator is **delayed business reveal**:

```
BROWSING PHASE          CLAIMING PHASE
─────────────────       ─────────────────
• See deal details      • Create account
• See pricing           • Submit contact info
• See location area     • Choose preferred time
• See ratings           • Accept terms
• NO business name      → REVEAL business name
                        → Show phone/email/address
                        → Business receives lead
```

### Why This Matters

| For Consumers | For Businesses |
|--------------|----------------|
| Browse without pressure | No tire-kickers |
| Compare on merit, not brand | Leads know the price already |
| Control when to engage | Higher conversion rates |
| Privacy until ready | Qualified interest only |

## Summary

CostFinders starts as a solution to a specific problem — opaque medical spa pricing — but is designed as a **platform** that can expand horizontally (more services within medspas) and vertically (more industries with similar characteristics).

The core insight: **consumers want pricing transparency, businesses want qualified leads**. By bridging that gap with a claim-based reveal mechanism, CostFinders creates value for both sides while building a defensible marketplace.
